Adding Tasks
************

In this section, we will take a look at how we can add more tasks to our base script from the 
:ref:`Getting Started <uguide_get_started>` section.

.. note:: The reader is assumed to be familiar with the :ref:`PST Model <app_model>` and to have read through 
    the :ref:`introduction` of Ensemble Toolkit.

.. note:: This chapter assumes that you have successfully installed Ensemble Toolkit, if not see :ref:`Installation`.

You can download the complete code discussed in this section :download:`here <../../examples/user_guide/add_tasks.py>` 
or find it in your virtualenv under ``share/radical.entk/user_guide/scripts``.        

Below, you can see the code snippet that shows how you can create more Task objects
and **add** them to the Stage using the **add_task()** method.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/user_guide/add_tasks.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 24-35
    :dedent: 4


.. code-block:: bash

    python add_tasks.py


Let's take a look at the complete code in the example. You can generate a more verbose output by setting the environment
variable ``RADICAL_ENTK_VERBOSE=DEBUG``.
